This mod allows loading mods from directories outside the traditional `Mods` directory where the game resides.

Particularly useful if you want to:
- Organize mods and separate them by author, category, or whichever way you like.
- Separate mods made by other people from mods made by yourself, especially if you're a mod developer.
- Quickly add and remove a set of mods that you'd want to test.

&lt;size=24&gt;Usage&lt;/size&gt;
- Go to this mod's options.
- Enter in the path from which mods will be loaded, and click Add Mods Folder.
- The path will show up in a list above, which will also show previously added mods folders.
    * You can remove a path by clicking either on the path itself on the list or the check box.
- Changes are saved immediately upon closing the options window.
    * If the mod's options was opened from the mods configuration window, you have to close that window too.

&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;
- This is incompatible with any mod that also requires the use of UnityDoorstop.
    * This mod requires UnityDoorstop because it has to modify the game's mod loading process, which cannot be achieved by a regular mod.
- This was not tested on non-Windows platforms.
